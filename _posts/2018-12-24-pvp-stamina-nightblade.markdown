## Gear Explained

- [Dubious Camoran Throne][dubious-camoran-throne] enables Bone Pirate's Tatters fifth bonus: 2000 Stamina and 150 Stamina Recovery.
- Kra'gh and Molag Kena give us extra penetration and weapon damage for Battlegrounds.
- Weapon traits and Jewellery glyphs also give us extra penetration and weapon damage for Battlegrounds.  
- Impenetrable trait on armour mitigates against being a glass cannon.
- Consider using Stamina glyphs on smaller armour pieces for additional damage.
- Use Unstoppable potions when not running Shuffle or Forward Momentum because you need to stay mobile.
- Use Increase Speed potion when not buffed by Rapids or an ally because you need to stay mobile (again).
- Potions:
  - Immune to knockbacks and disabling effects, Restore Stamina and Increase Speed
    -  Blessed Thistle
    - [Columbine][columbine]
    - Namira's Rot
  - Immune to knockbacks and disabling effects, Restore Stamina and Restore Health
    - Columbine
    - Mountain Flower
    - Namira's Rot

## Skills Explained

- Keep Rally and Relentless Focus up all the time for buffs.
- Use Resolving Vigor followed by Shadowy Disguise when low on health.
- Use Rally burst heal if still low on health after going into stealth.
- Use Mass Hysteria followed by dodge roll (on bow still) and sprint when out numbered (aim to break line of sight).
- You can swap Mass Hysteria for:
  - Razor Caltrops - Offensive CC
  - Shadow Image - Defensive mobility
  - Shuffle - Defensive mobility
- Ranged / melee opener (weave light attacks):
  - Shadowy Disguise
  - Lethal Arrow
  - Poison Arrow
  - Ambush
  - Surprise Attack
  - Executioner
- The range / melee opener should be enough for most targets.
- If not then use Incapacitating Strike to stun before executing.
- If ultimate not ready then stealth before applying surprise attack to stun.
- Then double tap the executioner (if still not dead).
- Ranged opener (when targets are good at grouping):
  - Shadowy disguise
  - Lethal Arrow
  - Razor Caltrops
  - Poison Arrow
  - Poison Arrow
  - Poison Arrow
  - Assassin's Scourge
  - Toxic Barrage
- Remember to light attack weave to trigger Assassin's Scourge.
- If you dislike range only then use Shadow image combined with Surprise Attack to jump in and out of melee.
